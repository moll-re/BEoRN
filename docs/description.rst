Bubbles during Epoch Of Reionization Numerical-simulator (BEoRN).

This package provides tools to simulate the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during cosmic dawn and reionization. It leverages semi-numerical methods to efficiently model the growth of ionized regions (bubbles) around early galaxies embedded in dark matter halos.

BEoRN is designed to be **flexible**, **user-friendly**, and **fast**. It allows researchers to efficiently explore various astrophysical scenarios and their impact on the 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen.
