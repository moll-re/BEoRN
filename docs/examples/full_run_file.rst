====================
Full run example
====================

This file serves as a reference for a full run, in a python file instead of a notebook. This can be used on remote systems, e.g. in an HPC environement
This example makes the following assumptions:

 - the global parameters for this run are specified as a yaml file under ``./parameters.yaml``
 - the underlying nbody input data has been generated by the THESAN simulation and resides under ``<scratch>/Thesan/``
 - during the simulation, intermediate and output data is written to ``<scratch>/thesan_run/`` (beware of the 100GB+ files this may generate)
