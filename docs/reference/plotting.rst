Plotting

.. note::
    Now that we have computed spatial quantities, possibly for multiple redshifts, it is often useful to visualize them. Grids can easily be represented as 2D slices or projected along an axis.

    It is however more involved to visualize statistical quantities and their evolution with redshift. The functions in this module help with that, providing easy ways to plot power spectra and signals as a function of redshift.

    These functions can be used in scripts or in Jupyter notebooks and aim to provide an easy way to compare results from different simulation runs.
