.. note::
   These data structures represent the main input and output data that `beorn` works with. They include:

   - the flux profiles that describe radiation fields around sources
   - the catalogs of halos used to give spatial context to the data
   - the resulting output grids of radiation and ionization fields (in one or multiple redshift slices)
